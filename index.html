                    <h4>Why Spiritual Fitness is Important</h4>
    
                       <p>
                        Each side of the YMCA’s triangle is of equal length, thus it is known as an equilateral triangle. This suggests that all three sides - representing spirit, mind, and body - deserve equal attention and development. I recognized the triangle long before I began my YMCA professional career. And obviously, it’s been in front of me for all those years!
    
                        While many YMCAs have allowed somewhat of a “mission drift” many associations do a wonderful job of keeping the “C” strong in the YMCA. You can find many examples of how they do this, but you’d have to look pretty closely.
    
                        Even beyond the YMCA, many would agree that as individuals we do need to maintain a healthy balance between our physical, mental and spiritual health. Thus, maintaining our spiritual fitness is an important part of our well-being.
    
                        Being “fit” in any of these areas is not easy. You can’t just drink a special solution, take a certain pill, or even read a self-improvement book. It takes work. I’ve chosen to focus on the “spiritual” so that individuals can maintain an often neglected side of the triangle.</p>

                    <p>Time spent in prayer is never wasted. There is an ongoing effort to pray for individuals by name. We elect to notify that person when we have lifted them in prayer as a way to encourage them! Ongoing prayer lists include: Pathway House Prayer Team (daily prayer), YMCA CEO Prayer Ministry (list includes 31 YMCA leaders in our region), USMN Prayer Ministry (list includes 62 Chaplains and Christian emphasis staff located all over the country), Greenwood Community Service Prayer Ministry (includes top leadership in 5 agencies), Lander Coaches Prayer Ministry (includes 13 coaches and the AD).</p>

                      <p id="prayerMinistry">Prayer Ministry- George Williams, the founder of the first Young Men's Christian Association, believed strogly in prayer. He and the other men, at the founding of the YMCA, made a practice of praying specifically for people by name. That practice continues and we maintain serveral 'prayer list' where individual names are lifted up in prayer. For instance, rahter than praying for all the schools as the new school year approaches, we'd rather pray for a list of individula teachers by name. It would take some time, but our Lord wants a personal relationship with each of us, so why shouldn't we make our prayers specifacally for persons by name. Spiritual Fitness Ministries can organize your supporters into a prayer team designed to champion your ministry by intercessory prayer.</p>

                    This is an appeal to my YMCA friends and colleauges all over the country.

                    I am often asked what will happen to the program. I firmly beleive that God will both perserve and promote this program and that
                     His plan for the program will play out just like He wants it.

                    I also beleive that the resident camps across the YMCA movment will continue to be the 'home' of the Ragger Society.
                     The program is simply designed and perfcet for the resident camp where campers participate over at least a one week period.
                      The program is still relevant today! Many camps still conduct the program, but the challenge remains to find someone hired at
                       camp to be the champion for the program and make sure young staff are exposed to it and have the opportunity to particapte. 
                       Those staff who will return to work for several summers can 'carry' the program on to a new wave of Raggers. Let's keep this going!

                    That is not to say that summer day camp programs aren't a good fit. I have always thought the day camp staff should have the 
                    opportunity to learn about the Raggers and participate over teh summer. For some, an intruduction during training week is a great
                     way to do that. perhaps day camp staff training also includes ceremonies for any staff who have accepted a challenge. There could
                      also be other opportunitites during the summer season.

                    Many camps will conduct the program, create a Raggers Point, but after a season or two, find themselves without someone to get 
                    it rekindled! There are Raggers who will gladly assist you in getting the traditional Raggers Program back into your camp.

                    As some of you know, the Raggers Creed is from a hymn, written in the early 1900’s. Listen to the first two verses of the hymn 
                    here! I hope you enjoy it!

                    If you would like ANY assistance at all with your Raggers Program, no matter if its to get started for the first time or to 
                    rekindle it, please feel free to contact me about available resources.
