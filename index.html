                    <h4>Why Spiritual Fitness is Important</h4>
    
                       <p>
                        Each side of the YMCA’s triangle is of equal length, thus it is known as an equilateral triangle. This suggests that all three sides - representing spirit, mind, and body - deserve equal attention and development. I recognized the triangle long before I began my YMCA professional career. And obviously, it’s been in front of me for all those years!
    
                        While many YMCAs have allowed somewhat of a “mission drift” many associations do a wonderful job of keeping the “C” strong in the YMCA. You can find many examples of how they do this, but you’d have to look pretty closely.
    
                        Even beyond the YMCA, many would agree that as individuals we do need to maintain a healthy balance between our physical, mental and spiritual health. Thus, maintaining our spiritual fitness is an important part of our well-being.
    
                        Being “fit” in any of these areas is not easy. You can’t just drink a special solution, take a certain pill, or even read a self-improvement book. It takes work. I’ve chosen to focus on the “spiritual” so that individuals can maintain an often neglected side of the triangle.</p>

                    <h4>Active Prayer Ministry</h4>
                    
                    <p>Time spent in prayer is never wasted. There is an ongoing effort to pray for individuals by name. We elect to notify that person when we have lifted them in prayer as a way to encourage them! Ongoing prayer lists include: Pathway House Prayer Team (daily prayer), YMCA CEO Prayer Ministry (list includes 31 YMCA leaders in our region), USMN Prayer Ministry (list includes 62 Chaplains and Christian emphasis staff located all over the country), Greenwood Community Service Prayer Ministry (includes top leadership in 5 agencies), Lander Coaches Prayer Ministry (includes 13 coaches and the AD).</p>
