                    <h4>Why Spiritual Fitness is Important</h4>
    
                       <p>
                        Each side of the YMCA’s triangle is of equal length, thus it is known as an equilateral triangle. This suggests that all three sides - representing spirit, mind, and body - deserve equal attention and development. I recognized the triangle long before I began my YMCA professional career. And obviously, it’s been in front of me for all those years!
    
                        While many YMCAs have allowed somewhat of a “mission drift” many associations do a wonderful job of keeping the “C” strong in the YMCA. You can find many examples of how they do this, but you’d have to look pretty closely.
    
                        Even beyond the YMCA, many would agree that as individuals we do need to maintain a healthy balance between our physical, mental and spiritual health. Thus, maintaining our spiritual fitness is an important part of our well-being.
    
                        Being “fit” in any of these areas is not easy. You can’t just drink a special solution, take a certain pill, or even read a self-improvement book. It takes work. I’ve chosen to focus on the “spiritual” so that individuals can maintain an often neglected side of the triangle.</p>

                    <h4>Active Prayer Ministry</h4>
                    
                    <p>Time spent in prayer is never wasted. There is an ongoing effort to pray for individuals by name. We elect to notify that person when we have lifted them in prayer as a way to encourage them! Ongoing prayer lists include: Pathway House Prayer Team (daily prayer), YMCA CEO Prayer Ministry (list includes 31 YMCA leaders in our region), USMN Prayer Ministry (list includes 62 Chaplains and Christian emphasis staff located all over the country), Greenwood Community Service Prayer Ministry (includes top leadership in 5 agencies), Lander Coaches Prayer Ministry (includes 13 coaches and the AD).</p>

Stallworth has been portraying Williams to tell the story in first person for over 13 years and can gear the presentation to different audiences.</p>

A 30-Day Prayer Challenge can engage staff, volunteers, and supporters. Don't let "Mission Drift" pull your focus away from your deep Christian heritage.</p>

                      <p id="prayerMinistry">Prayer Ministry- George Williams, the founder of the first Young Men's Christian Association, believed strogly in prayer. He and the other men, at the founding of the YMCA, made a practice of praying specifically for people by name. That practice continues and we maintain serveral 'prayer list' where individual names are lifted up in prayer. For instance, rahter than praying for all the schools as the new school year approaches, we'd rather pray for a list of individula teachers by name. It would take some time, but our Lord wants a personal relationship with each of us, so why shouldn't we make our prayers specifacally for persons by name. Spiritual Fitness Ministries can organize your supporters into a prayer team designed to champion your ministry by intercessory prayer.</p>
